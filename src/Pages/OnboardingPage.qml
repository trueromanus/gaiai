    /*
Hello newcomer and welcome to your new Temple House City Government family!
Our city is not very big, but by becoming a part of our city and city government, you will become part of a warm and cozy family!
You are our new system operator, congratulations!
But first of all, what does it mean to be a systems operator?
You take on great power (of course, with great responsibility) and become the watchmen of the city of Temple House. You like a superhero, but without a cape, and if something breaks, you just fix it and make everyone in our city happy.
