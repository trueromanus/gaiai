    /*
Hello newcomer and welcome to your new Temple-House City Government family!
Our city is not very big, but by becoming a part of our city and city government, you will become part of a warm and cozy family!
You are our new system operator, congratulations!
But first of all, what does it mean to be a systems operator?
You take on great power (of course, with great responsibility) and become the watchmen of the city of Temple-House. You like a superhero, but without a cape, and if something breaks, you just fix it and make everyone in our city happy.

Your shift will start at 21:00 in the evening and end at 09:00 in the morning of the next day.
Immediately after accepting the shift, you need to check your tasks in the SmartCityTracker program.
All mandatory tasks must be completed before the end of the shift.
